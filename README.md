# LVCA-Net
LVCA-Net: Lightweight LiDAR Semantic Segmentation for Advanced Sensor-Based Perception in Autonomous Transportation Systems
To run this backbone inside MMDetection3D v1.4, you must first recreate the environment exactly as recorded in your pip list, since this project relies on the original dependency stack used by Cylinder3D (mmcv-full, spconv, PyTorch, and CUDA versions must match). After preparing the same environment, simply place the provided LiteAsymm3D backbone file into mmdet3d/models/backbones/ and update the Cylinder3D config to use type='LiteAsymm3D'. No other changes are required—the backbone is fully compatible with the voxel encoder and segmentation head of MMDetection3D v1.4. Once replaced, the model can be trained, evaluated, and visualized using the standard MMDetection3D scripts.
